# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh

# This is my first completed project with tailwindcss
It is also the fist project created with vite
This project was inspired from a React 18 crash course from traversy media
With this project you can add new job, edit job and delete job.
Key skills I acqire from this project was the ability to configure ESLint rules on my own for the first time, and also using tailwindCSS to build a project.
Other vital skills includes( documentation, using chrome/edge dev tools, debugging components, surfing for solutions to bugs.
I am very excited to complete this project.
